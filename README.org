* Taf Programming Language

Taf is an experimental dialect of Lisp aiming at a tractable
implementation of three expressive constructs: hygienic macros for
syntax abstraction, delimited continuations for control abstraction,
and row polymorphism for value abstraction.

Taf is currently being developed by [[mailto:msimoni@gmail.com][Manuel Simoni]].
